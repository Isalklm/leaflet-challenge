## 🚀 Project Overview

This project visualizes earthquake data using Leaflet.js and multiple base layers. It includes:
- **Earthquake Markers**: Color-coded based on depth and size based on magnitude.
- **Tectonic Plate Boundaries**: Displayed as an overlay.
- **Layer Controls**: Allows toggling between different base maps.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Fetching real-time data from USGS earthquake API.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the page.
- **CSS**: For styling the visualization.
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity and data handling.
- **D3.js**: For fetching earthquake data dynamically.
- **Leaflet.js**: For mapping and visualization.
- **GitHub Pages**: For deployment.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used in this visualization comes from the [USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson). It includes:
- **Magnitude**
- **Depth**
- **Location**
- **Time of occurrence**

## 📜 Instructions

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the visualization.
2. Use the layer controls to toggle between different base maps and overlays.
3. Earthquake markers are color-coded based on depth, with larger markers representing stronger earthquakes.

## 🏷 Attribution and Code Sources

This project was developed as part of a bootcamp program. The code for data visualization, interactive charts, and dynamic updates was written in JavaScript using **D3.js** and **Leaflet.js**. The dataset was fetched dynamically from the **USGS Earthquake API**.
